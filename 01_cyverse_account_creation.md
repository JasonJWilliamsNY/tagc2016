# Sign up for a CyVerse account 

A key feature of CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is that one set of credentials (your CyVerse username and password) connect you to all CyVerse platforms. 

> **Note:** During the transition from iPlant Collaborative to CyVerse, you will see platforms independently being updated with new logos and color schemes. No actions are required on your part; these changes will not alter system functionalities. 


## Sign up from user portal

1. Visit the user portal at: [https://user.cyverse.org/](https://user.cyverse.org/)
2. Register for a CyVerse account
3. Check your email for an account confirmation link and follow the confirmation instructions. 

> **Tips:** 
-  Register using your **.edu**, **.org**, or **.gov** email address (access to some platforms may be restricted for non-institutional users).<br>
- Choose a short, easy-to-remember username.   Username must be lowercase and have at least 3 characters. First character must be a lowercase letter. May only contain lowercase letters, numbers, dashes and underscores (_). <br>
- Choose a very secure password. Never give this password to anyone.<br> 
- Students can and should create their own accounts.
